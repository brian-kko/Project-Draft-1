      New York is the most densely populated city in the United States, <br>
      with over 29,000 people per square mile. Our residents produce <br>
      12,000 tons of waste daily, and more than 14 million tons are produced
      in our city annually.

      Approximately 80 percent of our trash end up in landfills, and the <br>
      remainder ends up in incinerators or composting and recycling plants. <br>
      In landfills, garbage takes several decades to decades to break down. <br>
      Organic waste are also unable to decompose naturally, causing the <br>
      release of methane gas.

      Trash and litter in our streets also end up in our waterways and oceans <br>
      through storm drains and sewers. 5 billion gallons of waste flows into <br>
      the East River each year, and the Hudson River is generally considered <br>
      unsafe to swim in due to the presence of man-made chemicals and pathogens.
